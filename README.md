# CV
CV Template based on Michael DeCorte's resume style (1989)

It uses the same `resume.cls` as DeCorte's original style. The sample file is hacked a bit to format more nicely. It uses `XeLaTeX` and a few fonts that I have installed. Other users of this template will have to modify those if they don't have these fonts.
